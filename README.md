## FAQs

Reason for Selling

- Downsizing and not really using the vehicle that much. I would rather have someone who loves offroading to own this para magamit talaga full potential.

Did you offroad this?

- Yes we did, but only on light trails (Camp Boa, Lake Mapanuepe). Takot ako i-drive to sa mga hardcore trails.

Is 4x4 Working?

- Yes it's working along with 4Hi and 4Lo (for moderate and difficult offroad trails respectively)
